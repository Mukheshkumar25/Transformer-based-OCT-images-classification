# Retinal OCT Disease Classification using MobileViT-XS

This project implements a lightweight **MobileViT-XS** model to classify retinal OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images into four categories:

- **CNV** (Choroidal Neovascularization)
- **DME** (Diabetic Macular Edema)
- **DRUSEN**
- **NORMAL**

The model is trained on a **10% stratified subset** of the OCT2017 dataset and achieves high accuracy while remaining efficient enough for CPU inference and deployment.

## 📘 Reference Paper

This project is based on the architecture described in:

**MobileViT: Light-weight, General-purpose, and Mobile-friendly Vision Transformer**  
Sachin Mehta, Mohammad Rastegari  
Paper Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02178

Key ideas used from the paper:

- Combination of **CNNs (local features)** and **Transformers (global features)**
- Patch-based global attention
- Lightweight architecture suitable for mobile/edge deployment

## 📦 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/OCT-MobileViT-Classification.git
cd OCT-MobileViT-Classification
```

### 2️⃣ Create & Activate Virtual Environment

**Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🖼 Run Inference on a Single Image

Place an OCT image (JPG/PNG) inside the project folder.

Then run:

```bash
python infer.py
```

You will see:

```
Prediction: CNV (96.12% confidence)
```

---

## 🌐 Run Streamlit Web Application

To launch the web interface:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open a local browser at:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

Upload any OCT image and the app will classify it using the trained MobileViT-XS model.

## 📁 Dataset

This project uses the publicly available **OCT2017 Retina Dataset** which contains four classes:

- CNV
- DME
- DRUSEN
- NORMAL

A 10% stratified subset was used to reduce compute load while maintaining class representation.
